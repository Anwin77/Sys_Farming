      <h1>Corn</h1>
      <img src="https://www.foodrepublic.com/img/gallery/corn-is-a-fruit-but-its-also-a-grain-and-a-vegetable/intro-1688390573.jpg" alt="Corn" />
      <p>Growing corn can be a rewarding experience. Here's a basic guide to growing corn:</p>
      <h2>1. Choose the Right Location:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Corn requires a lot of sunlight and prefers well-drained, fertile soil. Choose a location that receives full sun throughout the day.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. Prepare the Soil:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Work the soil to a depth of about 8-12 inches, breaking up any clumps and removing weeds. Add organic matter such as compost or aged manure to enrich the soil.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Planting:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant corn seeds directly into the soil after the last frost date in your area, when the soil temperature is consistently above 55°F (13°C). Corn is usually planted in blocks rather than single rows to ensure proper pollination.</li>
        <li>Plant seeds about 1-2 inches deep and 8-12 inches apart in rows spaced 24-36 inches apart. If you're planting multiple rows, leave about 30-36 inches between rows.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. Watering:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep the soil consistently moist, especially during the germination and tasseling/silking stages. Water deeply, providing about 1-1.5 inches of water per week, either through rainfall or irrigation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Rice</h1>
      <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/99/150499-050-ECBF2AED/Rice-cultivation-path-flooded-rice-paddy-Philippines.jpg" alt="Rice" />
      <p>Growing rice requires specific conditions and techniques. Here's a basic guide to growing rice:</p>
      <h2>1. Choose the Right Location:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rice requires a warm climate with plenty of sunlight and access to water. Select a location with a flat or gently sloping terrain where water can be easily controlled.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. Prepare the Field:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rice is typically grown in flooded fields or paddies. Before planting, prepare the field by leveling the surface and creating a system for water management, such as irrigation channels or levees.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Select the Rice Variety:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose a rice variety that is well-suited to your climate and growing conditions. There are thousands of rice varieties, each with different characteristics such as growth duration, grain quality, and resistance to pests and diseases.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. Seed Preparation:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rice can be grown from either seeds or seedlings. If using seeds, pre-soak them in water for about 24 hours to encourage germination. Drain the water and spread the seeds out to dry slightly before planting.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>5. Planting:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant rice seeds or seedlings in prepared fields when the soil temperature reaches around 68-86°F (20-30°C). Space the seeds or seedlings evenly in rows, or broadcast them across the field for direct seeding.</li>
        <li>If transplanting seedlings, plant them about 6-8 inches apart in rows spaced about 8-12 inches apart.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Wheat</h1>
      <img src="https://5.imimg.com/data5/ST/QW/MY-38700875/fresh-wheat-crop.jpg" alt="Wheat" />
      <p>Growing wheat is a straightforward process, especially in regions with temperate climates. Here's a basic guide to growing wheat:</p>
      <h2>1. Selecting the Right Variety:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose a wheat variety suited to your climate and soil conditions. There are winter wheat varieties, which are planted in the fall and harvested the following summer, and spring wheat varieties, which are planted in the spring and harvested later the same year.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. Preparing the Soil:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wheat thrives in well-drained, fertile soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.5. Prepare the soil by tilling it to a depth of about 6-8 inches to break up any clumps and remove weeds. Incorporate organic matter, such as compost or well-aged manure, to improve soil fertility.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Planting:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant wheat seeds in the fall for winter wheat or in the spring for spring wheat. Sow the seeds at a depth of about 1-2 inches and space them 1-2 inches apart in rows spaced 6-8 inches apart. Ensure good seed-to-soil contact for optimal germination.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Growing soybeans is a relatively straightforward process. Here's a basic guide to growing soybeans:</p>
      <h2>1. Selecting the Right Variety:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose a soybean variety that is well-suited to your climate, soil type, and intended use (e.g., food, feed, or industrial purposes). Consider factors such as maturity, disease resistance, and yield potential when selecting a variety.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. Preparing the Soil:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Soybeans prefer well-drained, fertile soil with a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Test the soil before planting to determine its nutrient levels and pH. Incorporate lime or sulfur as needed to adjust the pH, and add organic matter such as compost or manure to improve soil structure and fertility.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Planting:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant soybeans after the last frost date in your area, when the soil temperature has warmed to at least 55°F (13°C) and is expected to remain consistently warm. Soybeans can be planted using a variety of methods, including drilling, broadcasting, or planting in rows.</li>
        <li>Plant soybean seeds at a depth of about 1-1.5 inches and space them 2-6 inches apart in rows spaced 7.5-15 inches apart, depending on the variety and planting method.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Potatoes</h1>
      <img src="https://hgtvhome.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/hgtv/fullset/2023/3/24/01/shutterstock_potato-field-vegetable-tubers-soil-dirt-310661561.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.1280.960.suffix/1679683308258.jpeg" alt="Potatoes" />
      <p>Growing potatoes is a satisfying endeavor and doesn't require a lot of space. Here's a step-by-step guide to growing potatoes:</p>
      <h2>1. Choosing Potato Varieties:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>There are many varieties of potatoes, including russet, red, yellow, and fingerling. Choose a variety based on your growing conditions and culinary preferences.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2. Preparing Seed Potatoes:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Purchase certified seed potatoes from a reputable source to ensure they are disease-free. Cut larger seed potatoes into pieces, each with at least one or two eyes (sprouts), and allow the pieces to cure for a few days in a cool, dry place.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Planting:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Plant potatoes in early spring, as soon as the soil can be worked and has warmed to at least 45°F (7°C). Choose a sunny location with well-drained, loose soil. Space seed pieces 12 inches apart in rows spaced 24-36 inches apart. Plant them 4 inches deep, with the eyes facing up.</li>
      </ul>
